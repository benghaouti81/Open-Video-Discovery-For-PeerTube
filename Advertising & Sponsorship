# Advertising & Sponsorship Policy

## Philosophy

This project was created as a response to the growing centralization, opacity, and abuse of power in modern advertising platforms.

Our goal is **not** to replace Google Ads, YouTube Ads, or any auction-based ad network.  
Our goal is to **restore direct, transparent, and ethical relationships** between:

- Content creators
- Advertisers
- Audiences

Advertising here is treated as **sponsorship and collaboration**, not surveillance or algorithmic exploitation.

---

## Core Principles

1. **No Surveillance**
   - No user tracking
   - No behavioral profiling
   - No cookies for ad targeting
   - No selling of user data

2. **No Auction System**
   - No real-time bidding
   - No hidden prioritization
   - No algorithm deciding who deserves visibility

3. **No Financial Intermediation**
   - The platform does **not** collect payments
   - The platform does **not** take commissions
   - The platform does **not** manage contracts

4. **Transparency by Design**
   - All advertising offers are public
   - All creator profiles are public
   - No hidden rules, shadow bans, or silent demotions

## Advertising Model: Open Sponsorship Marketplace

This project uses an **Open Sponsorship Model**, inspired by podcast sponsorships, newsletters, and open-source funding.

### How It Works

#### For Advertisers:
- Advertisers publish **Ad Intent Listings**, including:
  - Product or service description
  - Target audience or content niche
  - Budget range (optional)
  - Campaign duration
  - Contact method

#### For Content Creators:
- Creators publish **Creator Profiles**, including:
  - Content type and topics
  - Audience description
  - Accepted sponsorship types
  - Contact method

#### Matching:
- Advertisers and creators **find each other**
- Communication happens **directly**
- Negotiation happens **outside the platform**

The platform acts only as a **discovery layer**, not a broker.

## Geographic & Economic Reality

We acknowledge a global imbalance in advertising markets.

- Advertisers from wealthy regions can sponsor creators globally
- Creators from underrepresented regions are visible internationally
- No geographic restriction is imposed by the platform

This model prioritizes **niche relevance over geographic targeting**.

---

## What This Platform WILL Do

- Provide a neutral directory of creators and advertisers
- Offer basic filtering (topic, language, format)
- Encourage ethical and contextual advertising
- Protect user privacy by default
- Remain open-source and auditable

---

## What This Platform Will NEVER Do

- ❌ Run ads automatically
- ❌ Inject ads into videos
- ❌ Track viewers
- ❌ Enforce pricing models
- ❌ Act as a payment processor
- ❌ Rank creators based on revenue
- ❌ Favor advertisers over creators (or vice versa)

---

## Legal & Content Responsibility

- Content creators are fully responsible for their content
- Advertisers are fully responsible for their offers
- The platform does **not** endorse, verify, or guarantee any deal

### Prohibited Advertising Content:
- Illegal activities
- Fraud or scams
- Exploitative or deceptive practices
- Malware or harmful software

Moderation applies **only** at the listing level, not at the content level.

---

## Why This Matters

Modern advertising systems prioritize:
- Scale over value
- Control over creativity
- Profit over ethics

This project prioritizes:
- Human relationships
- Transparency
- Sustainability
- Long-term trust

---

## Future Evolution

This model is intentionally simple.

Possible future extensions (optional, community-driven):
- Reputation signals (non-monetary)
- Open statistics shared voluntarily
- Federated discovery between instances
- Community moderation tools

Any future change must respect the core principles above.

---

## Final Statement

This is not an anti-advertising platform.

It is an **anti-exploitation platform**.

Advertising should serve creators, audiences, and advertisers —  
not algorithms.
