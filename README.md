# Open Video Discovery for PeerTube

## Manifesto & Project Overview

---

### Why this project exists

This project was created to explore alternative, open, and transparent ways to index and discover video content in a federated ecosystem.
We didn’t start it because we have funding, a large team, or a marketing plan.  

We started it because we saw something quietly breaking.

For years, many people tried to share simple knowledge:  
- Someone explaining how to fix a device  
- Someone teaching a craft  
- Someone planting a seed of a useful idea  
- Someone sharing an experience that could help others  

These channels were innocent, calm, and educational.  
They didn’t chase trends, scandal, or viral content.  
They weren’t designed to make money.  

Yet algorithms didn’t notice them.  
Not because the content was bad, but because it wasn’t profitable.  

Slowly, creators learned a harsh lesson:  
> “If you don’t produce what the algorithm loves, you don’t exist.”

Some withdrew. Some adapted. Many remained unheard.  

Meanwhile, the platform became flooded with content that can only be described as **garbage**:  

- Recycled or repetitive videos  
- Clickbait titles  
- AI-generated content without soul  
- Videos targeting children with no regard for ethics, values, or education  

The question is no longer:  
> “Is this content useful?”  
but:  
> “Will it keep the user engaged the longest?”

This is the real break that inspired this project.

### What this project does

We are building a **single centralized website**:

- It does **not host videos**  
- It does **not re-upload videos**  
- It does **not change or control videos**  

It simply:  
> Collects information about videos, organizes it, and makes it discoverable

Videos remain:  
- On the creator’s server  
- Under the creator’s full control  
- With their own terms

We only collect metadata:  
- Title  
- Description  
- Thumbnail  
- Watch link  

Creators can submit:  
- A single video link  
- Or their entire channel  

The system uses PeerTube APIs to automatically fetch and update information.  
No manual approval. No human interference. No hidden algorithm.

### What users see

Users get a simple interface:  

- Search for videos or channels  
- Browse categorized content  
- Follow channels  
- Click a video and watch it **directly from the creator’s server**  

We are a **pass-through point**, not a destination.

---

### What we do NOT do

- We **do not own videos**  
- We **do not place ads**  
- We **do not impose hidden algorithms**  
- We **do not bury content because it’s not profitable**  
- We **do not ask creators to change their style**

The platform can order content:  
- Chronologically  
- Manually  
- Or by user preference  

Never based on engagement metrics alone.

---

### Who this project is for

- Small educational creators  
- Content that is calm and constructive  
- Videos that are often ignored by commercial platforms  
- Audiences looking to **discover, not just consume**  

---

### Why centralized?

Users want **one place to find content**, not dozens of scattered websites.  
Centralized **discovery**, not centralized control.  

If this site fails one day:  
- The code is open  
- The idea can be replicated  
- Nothing is lost

---

### How the project is managed

- Fully open-source  
- Transparent funding (donations/community support)  
- No data selling  
- Every decision is discussable  

---

### Future potential

If successful:  
- Better filters and search  
- Multiple interface options  
- Language and regional support  

If it fails:  
> It remains a genuine attempt to cut through the noise.

---

### Final word

This project doesn’t ask anyone to leave YouTube.  
It doesn’t claim to be the alternative.  

It simply says:  
> There is content worth seeing,  
> And we try to shine a light on it.

Anyone who sees themselves here is welcome:  
- As a user  
- A creator  
- A developer  
- Or a critic
